# Project 1: Predictive Modeling - Donors

Data science can be leveraged for non-profit fundraising by using models to predict donors for the current year. Analytics could also help identify cohorts and characteristics of potential donors. The aim of this project is to use an anonymized dataset to predict which constituent will donate in the current fiscal year.
This report will be laid out in several steps:

    Data Preparation: review of the data source and prepping the data for analysis.
    Data Analysis: Using visualization, a preliminary analysis of the constiuent base of the dataset.
    Prediction Models: Using 3 different models to attempt to predict who will be a current year donor.
    Summary: Findings from analysis and performance of the models.
