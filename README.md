# Projects

## [Project 1: Predictive Modeling - Donors](https://github.com/ngockle/Projects/tree/master/Donors%20Models)

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the current donors and constituent base.
Created and evaluated 3 models: Logistic regression, KNN, and XGBoost

    Data Preparation: review of the data source and prepping the data for analysis.
    Data Analysis: Using visualization, a preliminary analysis of the constiuent base of the dataset.
    Prediction Models: Using 3 different models to attempt to predict who will be a current year donor.
    Summary: Findings from analysis and performance of the models.

### Code and Resources Used
**Packages** pandas, numpy, sklean, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, statsmodels

## [Project 2: Contact Report Analysis](https://github.com/ngockle/Projects/tree/master/Contact%20Report%20Analysis)

    Created two models that perform sentiment analysis on contact reports to predict the interaction as positive, neutral, or negative using NLP packages VADER     and TextBlob.
    Created logistic regression models on sentiment scores to predict sentiment of future contact reports.
    Visualized the text data accordingly to respective sentiment with wordclouds.
    Performed topic modeling on negative contact reports to understand the themes and areas of concern.
